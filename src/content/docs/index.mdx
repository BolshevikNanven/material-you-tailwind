## What is this?

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

## Features

- **Material Design 3**: Follows the MD3 specification for a modern, accessible, and adaptive interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled efficiently with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Radix UI**: Built on top of Radix UI primitives for unstyled, accessible components.
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark mode support (Material You).
- **Customizable**: Copy only what you need and modify it to fit your brand.
